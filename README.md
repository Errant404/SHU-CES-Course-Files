**写在一切之前：**

- 因为一些**不可抗力因素**，评论部分只能删除
- 我不想再见，因为我已经害怕再见见面；我害怕交流，因为交流会互相伤害。我也没做任何事情，如果误解无法解除，那我只能将遗憾留到未来的世界。祝好呢，曾经的22级学弟、学妹组成的朋友们。

## 1. Introduction

The contents in this repository are e-books, review notes and materials for courses in School of Computer Engineering and Science, Shanghai University. 

## 2. Course Review

Although some teachers presented the latest exam papers at the end of the course, due to protection necessity and prudent considerations, some part of the information could not be made public.

However, I could **give some of the professor's initials due to his/her valuable review classes**.

**BEFORE READING, PLEASE NOTE THAT:**

1. **This table only includes courses that require exams and have parallel classes** (i.e. two or more teachers per course).
2. **Review classes may be more valuable than the previous exam papers.**
3. The teachers **whose names are bolded can provide useful information about the exam in the review session**, while the teachers whose names are not bolded can provide some information, and the teachers **who are not mentioned can provide almost no information**.
4. Due to the rapid turnover of teachers in the college, **the information in this table is current for the 2023-2024 academic year**.

## 3. Admonitions and Expectations

In terms of personal experience, due to SHU's three-semester academic system and the setting of CES's curriculum, students can get a high score of 90+ in most of the professional courses easily through the pre-exam assault.

Therefore, I hope you, younger students will spend most of your time on self-study, instead of wasting your time in the inter-involution of meaningless class content.

The last thing I want to say is that there is no use complaining. Just Do it.
